# Moderate batch size with more training iterations encourages faster learning
batch_size: 64
# Slightly larger network capacity to learn quickly
hidden_sizes: [256, 128]
# Reduced learning rate for stability while keeping reasonable speed
lr: 0.0003
gamma: 0.99
# Larger replay buffer to reduce sample correlation and improve stability

# Start learning after more experience to stabilize updates
learn_start: 1000
train_frequency: 1
# Fewer gradient steps per step to avoid destructive overfitting

# Notes:
# - This config aims to converge faster on CartPole-v1 by starting
#   learning earlier, using more training iterations per step, and
#   updating targets more frequently. It may be less stable on harder envs.
